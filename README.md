### User Stories

- As a user, I want to know the weather forecast for my location (by default)
- As a user, I want to search for a city at any time
- As a user, I want to know the weather of a city
- As a user, I want to see a loading event when waiting for the information

### Features

Search bar
Loading wheel
Current weather
Five-day forecast

### Flowchart

Page Loads -> Request user location -> Fetch weather information
-> Display loading wheel -> Display information

User Searches -> Fetch -> Display loading wheel -> Display information

### Architecture

model.js
export const state = {
-location
-weather info
}

controller.js
getLocation()
addHandlers()

view.js
render(state)
addHandlerSpinner(handler)
addHandlerReceiveInput(handler)
export default new View();

## Reflection

### Lessons & Difficulties

Error handling can be tricky. I saw a bug that I was not able to replicate. It had to do with throttling my API access. It is doubly strange because I thought this possibility was covered by the current error handling.

### Diary

The goal of the project is to practice API calls and promises. I will use async/await because it seems cleaner than other options. The website will not be super stylish, but it will not be pure HTML either.
